    <ol>
        <li>Toast for approximately 2 minutes.  Watch carefully that it doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Quickly spread the butter across the entire surface.  Don't be skimpy!</li>
        <li>Spread the jam over the butter.  It doesn't take as much as you'd think.</li>
        <li>Cut diagonally into 2 triangles.  Eat hot for best results.</li>
